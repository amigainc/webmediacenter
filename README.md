webmediacenter
==============

Web-based mediacenter with database and metada pick-up on allocine.fr

This is a personal project to get my own web-based media center. The system allows to rename films with year and title, update database with metadatas and search according to lanquage spoken, actor, director, genre...

The system allows to rename file according to film names recorded to allocine.fr. Of course you can adapt it to your favourite movie website (i.e: iMDB).

Code is PHP4-based (no or few obect-oriented), made on my free time. Feel free to adapt as you want.
